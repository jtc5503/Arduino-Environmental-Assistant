# Arduino Environmental Home Assistant
**Collaborative Project | Hardware Integration | Embedded Systems**

## Project Overview
Developed a smart home assistant designed to monitor and log environmental data in real-time. [cite_start]This project focused on sensor fusion, user interface design, and robust hardware wiring.

## Technical Features
* **Sensor Suite:** Integrated a photoresistor for light-level logging and various environmental sensors for atmospheric data.
* **User Interface:** Engineered a physical UI using an LCD display and tactile buttons for menu navigation.
* **Data Logging:** Programmed an Arduino Mega to process sensor inputs and display system status updates.
